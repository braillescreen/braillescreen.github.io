# BrailleScreen Repo List
This is a list of projects I have out there on the internet, as well as a short description of each.

In no order, they are as follows.

## My personal website
I have a lot of random stuff on [my website](https://pwilson-web.com) that you can check out.

## SBYW Map Checker
There is a game for the blind called [Scrolling Battles, Your World](https://www.ims-productions.com/SBYW.php). This program parses the data of maps you generate, and tells you how many of each type of object there are using the map's data.

# That's all for now.
Please come back soon as I will, in all probability, update this as time goes on. In case I forget, you can follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/braillescreen) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/braillescreen).

Thanks for visiting!
