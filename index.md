# BrailleScreen Repo List
Hello and welcome!

This is a short list of projects I'm making or am involved in.

In no order, they are as follows:

## NVGT (Nonvisual Gaming Toolkit)
I'm a contributor to the [Nonvisual Gaming Toolkit](https://nvgt.gg).  I work on the build scripts, documentation and other random parts from time-to-time.

## SBYW Map Checker
There is an audiogame for the blind called [Scrolling Battles, Your World](https://sbyw.games). This program parses the data of maps you generate, and tells you how many of each type of object there are using the map's data.

[Map Checker on GitHub](https://github.com/braillescreen/SBYWMapChecker).

## Random Top Speed Track
If you play the game Top Speed, you can generate tracks with this simple Python script.

# That's all for now.
Please note that this project list may not always be updated with latest involvements. Nevertheless, I hope this list was useful.

Thanks for visiting!
