# BrailleScreen Repo List
This is a list of projects I have out there on the internet, as well as a short description of each.

In no order, they are as follows.

## My personal website
I have a lot of random stuff on [my website](http://braillescreen.net) that you can check out.

## NVGT (Nonvisual Gaming Toolkit)
I'm a contributor to the [Nonvisual Gaming Toolkit](https://nvgt.gg).  I work on the build scripts, documentation and other random parts from time-to-time.

## SBYW Map Checker
There is a game for the blind called [Scrolling Battles, Your World](https://www.ims-productions.com/SBYW.php). This program parses the data of maps you generate, and tells you how many of each type of object there are using the map's data.

You can [check out that project here](https://github.com/braillescreen/SBYWMapChecker).

## Random Top Speed Track
If you play the game Top Speed, you can generate tracks with this simple Python script.

You can [check that out here](https://github.com/braillescreen/ts3-random-track)

# That's all for now.
Please come back soon as I will, in all probability, update this as time goes on. In case I forget, you can follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/braillescreen) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/braillescreen).

Thanks for visiting!
