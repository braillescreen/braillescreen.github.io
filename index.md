# Blackboard with Screen Readers.
If you use a screen reader such as NVDA or Voice-over, this document will attempt to help you navigate around blackboard and courses within.
This guide is still considered in beta and will certainly be updated. If you have anything you wish to add or point out that I didn't get to, please feel free to submit a PR.

## 1. Logging in.
To log in, go to [this website](https://blackboard.coursesites.com/).

If this happens to be your first time logging in, you will be presented with a privacy disclaimer. When you are done reading, you will find a button called "OK". Press it to continue.

You will land on the login screen. This is where you enter your user name and password you have.
The first two fields you will find is the user name and password fields. Below them, you have sign in, forgot your password, and create new account.

## I logged in, now what?
When logging in, you may find a weird anouncement. If you get it, there is a button called close below it, so you will need to press it.

After logging in, go to the top of the screen (near the address bar on iOS) and you will find the navigation. The navigation has the following items:
* Institution page: Where you are now. Currently this shows random information about Blackboard.
* Your name: View your profile or edit it.
* Activity stream: Get information about all of your enrolled classes such as important upcoming assignments or overdue ones.
* Courses: A list of all of you're enrolled courses. We will be using this in the section ahead.
* Organizations: List of all enrolled organizations.
* Calendar: View when assignments are due.
* Messages: Blackboard's messaging system to message students and teachers.
* Grades: View grades for each class.
* Tools: Blackboard settings.
* Sign out: Log out of your account.
